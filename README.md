# Final Project: EC 503 (Machine Learning)

- This repo contains work related to our group's final project for EC 503, "Introduction to Machine Learning", at Boston University.

- The project focused on benchmarking various multiclass SVM methods and relied heavily on "A comparison of methods for multiclass support vector machines" by Hsu and Lin (full citation below).

- The project report, which includes details on the approach, code, and results, can be viewed [here](EC503_final_project_report.pdf).
